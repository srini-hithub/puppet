
To deploy the puppet code in the Puppet 5.3:


==> Ensure the puppet server and client setup is done and signing is perfect.


1. Define the the environment.
	
    - copy the existing production directory to required folder.

	example : cp -rf /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production  /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/QA


2. Declare the resouce in the - write a pp file in the manifests.

  
    /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/QA/manifests/file.pp


3. On the agent side verify the configuration - 
	
   
    puppet config print |grep -i environment

   set the correct environment to QA

    puppet config set environments QA

    Apply the puppet run -

     puppet agent -t

  Note : This deployment is ad-hoc deployment using the puppet server.


4. To deploy the module:


     => Generate a puppet module 

     puppet module generate sri-modulename

  => we can copy the module to respective environment locations.

     cp modulename /etc/puppetlabs/code/environment/production/modules/
  
     or 
   
     puppet module install modulename  --modulepath=/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/QA/modules


 To call the module :
=====================

  => Define the module name in the site.pp in the respective environment's manifests folde.

 
     vi /etc/puppetlabs/code/environment/QA/manifests/site.pp

      ##we can call with the wild card or default key word.
		
      ## The below config applies to all the agents.
       
      node default {

        include module_name
  
        }

  or 
       node * {

       include module_name
	
          }


To deploy a specific nodes



    node '<server1>' , '<server2>'  {


     include module_specific
     
   }

Puppet server memory configuratuion:

==>/etc/sysconfig/puppetserver


JAVA_ARGS="-Xms2g -Xmx2g  => default setting in the /etc/sysconfig/puppetserver

This need to be changed as following.

JAVA_ARGS="-Xms512m -Xmx512m
